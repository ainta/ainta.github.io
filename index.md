## About me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Prof. Vladimir Kolesnikov. My research centers on cryptography, with particular interests in:

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
- Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

I am also competitive programming enthusiast, and participating online contests regularly (i.e., [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/ainta))

Before joining Georgia Tech, I earned my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University.
